Error: "Error.  Errno is: 121" 			Solution: Error suggesting problem lookig for address to connect.
							  It appeared because wiringPi lib supports only no. 1 i2c BUS and
							  Accelerometer was connected to the no. 0 i2c BUS so the wiringPi lib 
							  didn't see the connection. Reconnection to the BUS no. 1 worked.
